Distributed Machine Learning Tool Kit, or otherwise known as 
DMTK~\cite{hid-sp18-504-dmtk}, is Microsoft's response to the resource 
challenges that distributed machine learning faces. Given that machine 
learning trends are leaning towards leveraging more, and more, data to 
produce accurate results, Microsoft's DMTK attempts to mitigate the 
difficulties of keeping up with an equally demanding need for computational 
resources and scalability~\cite{hid-sp18-504-dmtk}. DMTK boasts an increasing 
number of components~\cite{hid-sp18-504-msresearch} ranging from topic 
model training algorithms to NLP algorithms, and counting. By making 
DMTK open source, Microsoft hopes to take advantage of the contributions 
from practitioners and researchers alike in order to enhance the DMTK’s 
components and make this powerful tool even more 
versatile~\cite{hid-sp18-504-msresearch}.

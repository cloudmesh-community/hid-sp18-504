Orange~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange} is a powerful data mining, visualization, 
and machine learning toolkit. Attracting practitioners with varying degrees of
technical background (including complete novices)~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange}, 
Orange's simple-to-use visual interface allows for the seamless application of 
complex data mining and machine learning concepts to derive insightful 
knowledge. Orange not only simplifies the application of in-depth data 
analysis, but it also helps bridge the gap between domain experts and 
data scientists by communicating the analytic processes clearly and 
effectively through visual representations~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange}. 
This open source toolkit's latest version (3+) uses various python libraries 
for computation, while utilizing the Qt framework for the visualization 
end~\cite{hid-sp18-504-wiki-orange}.

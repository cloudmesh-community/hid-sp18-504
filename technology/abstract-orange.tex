Orange~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange} is a  data mining, visualization,
and machine learning toolkit. Practitioners of Orange have can have
varying degrees of technical background (including complete
novices)~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange}, Orange has an interactive data
visualization interface which allows for a simpler approach to
perform complex data mining and machine learning practices and to
derive insightful knowledge. Orange also provides a visual programming
component which allows the user to utilize widgets to perform
qualitative analysis. These visualizations also assist in the communication
of analytic processes between domain experts and data
scientists~\cite{hid-sp18-504-orange}. This open source toolkit's
latest version (3+) uses various python libraries for computation,
while utilizing the Qt framework for the visualization
end~\cite{hid-sp18-504-wiki-orange}.

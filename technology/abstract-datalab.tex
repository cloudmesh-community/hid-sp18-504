Cloud Datalab \cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab} is an open source tool 
part of the Google Cloud Platform suite which focuses on delivering analytic, 
machine learning and visualization solutions. Fully integrated with the 
Platform Suite, Datalab takes full advantage by leveraging the data stored 
in various other Google solutions ranging from BigQuery and Machine Learning 
Engine to Compute Engine and Cloud Storage \cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab}. 
In addition to this integration, Cloud Datalab delivers a simple solution for 
developers to generate rich, insightful reports in a timely fashion that can 
further assist in their development tracks with greater
ease \cite{hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab}.  
Based on Jupyter \cite{hid-sp18-504-google-datalab}, Datalab has the 
advantage of a rich knowledge-base to start, and encourages developers 
to extend this open source software by simply 
forking it \cite{hid-sp18-504-techcrunch-datalab}.

KNIME Analytics Platform \cite{hid-sp18-504-pred-knime} is an open source 
platform focused on including machine learning components, data mining, 
analytics, and reporting; all executed through an intuitive visual interface. 
Since coding is optional through KNIME's graphical 
interface \cite{hid-sp18-504-knime}, workflows can be created to represent the 
individual steps in a dataflow, and allows the user to execute these steps 
selectively and view their output throughout different stages of their 
workflow \cite{hid-sp18-504-pred-knime}. To add to this platform's flexibility,
KNIME also offers both data and tool blending to allow for various data sources
(ranging from databases to images and networks) to be included in the same
workflow \cite{hid-sp18-504-knime}. Since KNIME is based on both Java 
and Eclipse, there are an extensive number of plugins available for 
integration to enhance the analytic experience \cite{hid-sp18-504-pred-knime}.
